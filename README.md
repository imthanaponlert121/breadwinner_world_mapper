  ### Changing Map Image

  In case if you want to change the map to your town, follow this step:

1. **Resize Image to 800x800**
   Always making sure that the image size is 800x800 in px, or else it won't fit in the Menu

2. **Image Independencies**
   Make sure to rename the images to **map.png** and put it in the same directory as the script is.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Note

This program is developed to help people find pearl more easily, I only use basic Turtle and Tkinter Module to draw and locate the pearl, it's all manually and it does not inject anything to Roblox.

If you like my tool, please consider give me a star, and feel free to give me comment, as I'm just a beginner.

Thank you for reading
